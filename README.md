Multimedia Tools
================

Different tools for Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision, including content-based image retrieval, video copy detection and k-NN searches.

Utility libraries:

  * `myutils`. General utility library written in GNU's C99 and C++11 standards, required by the other projects.

  * `metricknn`. MetricKnn addresses the problem of similarity search, i.e., to efficiently locate objects that are close to each other according to some distance function.

  * `p-vcd`. P-VCD addresses the problem of content-based video copy detection, i.e., to decide if any two videos presents the same content. It includes different algorithm for content description and similarity search.

These projects are developed on Windows (MinGW 32 y 64 bits environments) and Linux (GNU compiler).
