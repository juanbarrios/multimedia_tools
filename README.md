Multimedia Tools
================

Libraries and Tools written in C/C++ for Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision. 

They provide different algorithms for Content-Based Image Retrieval, Video Copy Detection and k-NN Searches.

Projects:

  * `P-VCD` addresses the problem of Content-Based Video Copy Detection, i.e., to decide if any two videos are visually similar. It contains different algorithms for content-based image and video retrieval. http://p-vcd.org/

  * `MetricKnn` focuses on the similarity search problem, i.e., to efficiently locate objects that are close to each other according to some distance function. http://metricknn.org/

  * `MyUtils` is a general utility library written in C/C++. Required by the other projects.

These projects are developed on Windows (MinGW 32 y 64 bits environments) and Linux (GNU compiler).
