Multimedia Tools
================

Tools for Multimedia Information Retrieval and Computer Vision.

Projects:

  * `P-VCD` addresses the problem of content-based video copy detection, i.e., to decide if any two videos are visually similar. It contains different algorithms for content-based image and video retrieval.

  * `MetricKnn` addresses the problem of similarity search, i.e., to efficiently locate objects that are close to each other according to some distance function.

  * `MyUtils` is a general utility library written in C/C++. Required by the other projects.

These projects are developed on Windows (MinGW 32 y 64 bits environments) and Linux (GNU compiler).
