P-VCD
=====

Content-Based Video Copy Detection.

This software is the result of my PhD at the University of Chile and the participation at TRECVID evaluation.

These libraries are developed on Windows (MinGW 32 y 64 bits environments) and Linux.

P-VCD has been described in some scientific papers, e.g., http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ICME.2011.6012212 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11042-011-0915-x

P-VCD has been used at TRECVID tasks: Content-Based Copy Detection (CCD) 2010-2011, Instance Search (INS) 2012-2014 and Multimedia Event Detection (MED) 2013-2014.
